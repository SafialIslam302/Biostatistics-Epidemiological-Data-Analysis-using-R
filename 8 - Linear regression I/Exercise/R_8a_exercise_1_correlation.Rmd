## Load KiGGS data

```{r}
dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/wkzl081n9lyaaew/KiGGS03_06.RData?dl=1")
load(dat_link)
dat <- KiGGS03_06
```

## Correlation

Choose 3 or more different variables and compute pairwise different correlation coefficients. Also look at scatterplots of the variables.

Also try to use the cor and plot for all 3 variables at once.

```{r}
...
```

Look at the results (correlation coefficients, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests), compare and interpret them.
